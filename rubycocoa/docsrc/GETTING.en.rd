from ((<file list|URL:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=44114>)).

== Source Distribution

Download
((<rubycocoa-0.4.2.tgz|URL:http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rubycocoa/rubycocoa-0.4.2.tgz?download>))
from ((<file list|URL:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=44114>)).

To build and install RubyCocoa, refer to 
((<"Build and Install RubyCocoa from Source"|URL:build.en.html>)).


== Getting Development Source from CVS Server

The latest (or the oldest) development source is available from the 
((<CVS Server|URL:http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=44114>)).

You can
((<view the CVS Repository|URL:http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rubycocoa/>))
for RubyCocoa. On the shell command line, type this:

  $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/rubycocoa login
  $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/rubycocoa co \
        -P -d rubycocoa src
  $ cd rubycocoa
  $ cvs update -d -P

All of the source for RubyCocoa is downloaded into a directory named 'rubycocoa'.

Building may fail because of the nature of CVS. Some cvs commands such as
'cvs update' or 'cvs status -v' will be helpful. Use these commands
with appropriate options.


== DarwinPorts 

((<DarwinPorts|URL:http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/>)) has a port 
"rb-cocoa" for RubyCocoa(0.4.1). 

The port requires DarwinPorts version 1.1. You can update your DarwinPorts 
with following command:

  $ sudo port -d selfupdate

== PINEAPPLE RPM Package

RPM format binary (0.2.x) exist on
((<Project PINEAPPLE (Japanese)|URL:http://sacral.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hasimoto/Pineapple/>)).
